VECTOR
vector < int > v(10);
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  v[i] = (i + 1) * (i + 1);
}
for (int i = 9; i > 0; iâ€“) {
  v[i] -= v[i - 1];
}


The empty vector is created. Be careful with constructions like this:
vector < int > v(10);

 create the two-dimensional vector of given size:
vector < vector < int > > Matrix(N, vector < int > (M, -1));
