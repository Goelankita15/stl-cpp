vector continous so can be accessed simply as array 
for(int i =0; i<n; i++){
    cout <<v[i] <<" " ;
}

vector<int> :: iterator it = v.begin()  -> declartion
*(it+1)

RANGE BASED LOOPS ->
for(auto &it : v){
  cout << *it <<" ";
}

it + 1 and (it++)  => next location and next iterator 
since vector is continous  so it + 1 can also be used

auto keyword :-  dynamically assumed datatype or containers
